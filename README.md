## MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

# Objective:
AutosRUs is developing a new prototype vehicle, MechaCar. Jeremy, the data analytic's team leader was approached by upper management about a special project. MechaCar is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.


## MechaCar vs. Competition
There is Another statistical study that can be done to determine MechaCars standing against its competition is a linear regression on city and highway fuel efficiency. Gas is expensive these days and it is an important aspect that many buyers look at when buying a new car. Metrics that can be included in the analysis are:

City and highway fuel efficiency: dependent variable
Horse power: independent variable
Vehicle weight: independent variable
AWD capabilities: independent variable
MPG: independent variable In addition to the MPG, AWD, and vehicle weight data that we already have, we would have to collect fuel efficiency and horse power data for the sample data set at hand.

# Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils:
The overall variance for the entire dataset shows that the current manuf-data meets the 100 pounds per square inch variance limitation. when separated into three lots, the third lot demonstrates a much higher variance.  It may be stated that the dataset mean and the population mean are statistically similar, also the analysis predicts that the suspension coils dataset is statistically representative of the population mean.
